# Decarbonization App

## Overview
Welcome to the Decarbonization App repository! This project aims to revolutionize the steel and cement industries by providing a comprehensive software solution for decarbonization. Our application serves as a central platform for manufacturers to assess their emissions footprint, explore decarbonization pathways, and implement sustainable practices.

## Features
### 1. AI-powered Emissions Modeling
Utilizing cutting-edge machine learning techniques, our app analyzes real-time production data to accurately predict emissions. This feature provides manufacturers with invaluable insights into their environmental impact.

### 2. Scenario Planning & Optimization
With our scenario planning tool, users can simulate various decarbonization strategies and assess their impact on emissions and production costs. From biochar integration to solar calcination, the possibilities for optimization are endless.

### 3. Sustainable Material Management Module
Our marketplace facilitates the sourcing and utilization of recycled materials in cement production, promoting circular economy principles and reducing reliance on virgin resources.

### 4. Digital Collaboration Platform
Connect with stakeholders including manufacturers, policymakers, and researchers to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and drive collective action towards sustainability goals.

## Tech Stack
- *Core*: Python (Flask), Java
- *Data Science/AI*: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- *Visualization*: Dash, Plotly
- *Cloud Platform*: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform

## Implementation Prerequisites
To successfully implement the Decarbonization App, the following prerequisites are essential:
- Collaboration between steel/cement companies, data providers, and sustainability experts to develop a comprehensive emissions database and industry benchmarks.
- Integration with existing plant monitoring systems to collect real-time production data.
- Regulatory support for data privacy and security.

## Revenue Models
We offer two revenue models for our Decarbonization App:
### 1. Subscription Model
Steel and cement manufacturers pay a monthly or annual subscription fee for access to core features such as emissions modeling, scenario planning, and the sustainable materials marketplace. This model provides recurring revenue and encourages long-term engagement.
### 2. Pay-per-Use Model
Users pay a fee for specific functionalities such as in-depth emissions analysis reports or optimization of complex decarbonization scenarios. This model caters to companies with occasional use of advanced features.
